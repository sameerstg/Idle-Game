<entry name="TUTORIAL_89_HALLOWEEN">I have gone ahead and set up a good military camp to resist the Zombie Invasion. We will be receiving recruits for training very soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_9_REDUCTED">Any of the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;prison guards&lt;/color&gt; can do that. </entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98_VALENTINE">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These aliens&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83_CHRISTMAS">I have just been informed that a fleet of alien ships have been sighted entering the atmosphere with hostile intentions. They don&#39;t even respect Christmas anymore...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_1_REDUCTED">So, you&#39;re the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;new manager&lt;/color&gt; they sent to run this hellhole?</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_76">OK, I’ll explain everything quickly. I don&#39;t want to stay a minute longer than necessary in this dump.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_77">In the upper part you will see the objectives that need to be to achieved in order to be rewarded by the government.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_74">You&#39;re going to love it…</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_75">Wow! This place is even worse than I imagined. I&#39;m too old for this….</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_72">We&#39;ll get the best staff possible which will also ensure you the best security and conditions in other prisons.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Iron Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_70">Quite a challenge, right? And it&#39;s up to you to make it work.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_71">But we&#39;ll have a lot to gain if we can reform enough prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_48_REDUCTED">Don&#39;t lose sight of the prisoners. Your role as manager is to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;rehabilitate&lt;/color&gt; them. Monitor things properly so they don&#39;t get out of hand which could trigger a riot.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_64">Since these prisoners are problematic, they tend to be moved from one prison to another to keep them from causing trouble with other inmates.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69_SUMMER">A prison lost in the middle of the Caribbean! Vacation for some, prison for others: Don&#39;t try to swim in its waters without wearing your swimsuit!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_79">The more prisoners we reform, the more cards we can get and the higher the bonus for the legendary card.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_89_CHRISTMAS">I have gone ahead and set up a good military camp to resist the Christmas Invasion. We will be receiving recruits for training very soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_89_VALENTINE">I have gone ahead and set up a good military camp to resist the Disco Invasion. We will be receiving recruits for training very soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_18_REDUCTED">The prisoner is now in his cell, so let’s get down to work. Why don’t we start &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;by improving the prisoner’s cell&lt;/color&gt;?</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_128">Gee, it looks like the prison&#39;s balance sheet is in &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;red numbers&lt;/color&gt;. Hurry! Something must be done before we run out of money...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_138">Darn! Now we&#39;ve run out of water in the reservoir. We&#39;re going to need more &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;water&lt;/color&gt; to keep upgrading the prison.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_108">That way, maybe the prisoners won&#39;t destroy everything because they’re hungry…</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_118">The guards will try to calm the prisoners down by force. The more guards you have, the easier it is for you to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;quell the riot&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_50_REDUCTED">Man, I&#39;m beat! I think I&#39;ll take the day off. Now it’s up to you. Good luck!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83_SUMMER">I have just been informed that a fleet of alien ships have been sighted entering the atmosphere with hostile intentions. They don&#39;t even respect summer vacation anymore...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73_SUMMER">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Beach Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69_VALENTINE">A prison lost in the middle of the ocean! A place where all the prisoners who did misdeeds for love end up. So they can say that breakups don&#39;t hurt...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_132">Great! Remember that more prisoners equals &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;more money&lt;/color&gt; per hour, so don&#39;t stop building cells and the money will come pouring in.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_102">In space, food is scarce and it will no be easy to feed everyone. You need to transform ingredients into meals.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_112">But first build some &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;cells&lt;/color&gt; to earn lots of money! You know how it works...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98_CHRISTMAS">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These christmas aliens&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_27">If the indicator &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;changes color&lt;/color&gt;, it means his comfort level is getting worse. The closer to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;red&lt;/color&gt; it gets, the more &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;dangerous&lt;/color&gt; and unstable the prisoner will get.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_78">The most important is to try and get the legendary staff, so hurry &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;before they close the prison&lt;/color&gt; and move it to another location.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_89_EASTER">I have gone ahead and set up a good military camp to resist the Ancient Invasion. We will be receiving recruits for training very soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_28">Prisoners have &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;6 different needs.&lt;/color&gt; Each &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;affect their stress level&lt;/color&gt; and should therefore be closely &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;monitored.&lt;/color&gt;</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_131">What a fortune you have amassed! Let&#39;s &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;build a cell&lt;/color&gt; so we can put more inmates behind bars.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_16">Okay, let&#39;s put these guys in their cells before they try to escape.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83_HALLOWEEN">I have just been informed that a fleet of alien ships have been sighted entering the atmosphere with hostile intentions. They don&#39;t even respect Halloween anymore...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69_JULY4TH">A prison lost in the middle of the ocean! The prisoners can forget their sorrows by watching the beautiful fireworks that are launched in this prison.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_NECESITY_TITLE">Needs</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_44">Right, I think it&#39;s time to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;build&lt;/color&gt; more cells so we can take in more prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_2_REDUCTED">Fantastic... Well, &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;I’d better show you&lt;/color&gt; some things if we don’t want this to be a disaster.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_87">But the government told me that those who train the most soldiers will be greatly rewarded.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_52">The government is happy with your work and wants you to take care of a new prison that can take in a larger number of prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_89_SUMMER">I have gone ahead and set up a good military camp to resist the Summer Invasion. We will be receiving recruits for training very soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_CHARACTER_NAME">Prison guard</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83_JULY4TH">I have just been informed that a fleet of alien ships have been sighted entering the atmosphere with hostile intentions. They don&#39;t even respect Independence&#39;s Day anymore...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_29_REDUCTED">The prison has a very strict schedule. You can always check the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;clock at the top of the screen&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73_CHRISTMAS">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Ice Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98_EASTER">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These ancient aliens&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_141">For every reformed prisoner you get a good pinch. So don&#39;t stop improving the prison to give a good service to society... and earn lots of &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;money&lt;/color&gt; in the meantime.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_121">Next time hire more guards and try to keep your prisoners happy to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;prevent riots&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_89_JULY4TH">I have gone ahead and set up a good military camp to resist the American Invasion. We will be receiving recruits for training very soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_101">Before I go for a drink in zero-G, here is what you need to know:</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_111">You can build a &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;laundry room&lt;/color&gt; and an &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;infirmary&lt;/color&gt; to improve the inmates&#39; quality of life.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_86">We won&#39;t be alone in our mission: all prisons in the world have been asked to do the same.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98_SUMMER">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These summer aliens&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_84">We must act quickly: we&#39;ve been asked to give all our prisoners military training and prepare them to defend us from their attack.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_85">We need many soldiers to fight off the invasion, and this is a good way to get more.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_82">Oh oh… we&#39;re in BIG trouble…</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83">The central government just informed me that they have detected extraterrestrial vessels coming towards us with hostile intentions.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_80">But as I&#39;ve already mentioned before, this place is really dangerous, and there is always some special prisoner who will make things difficult for us.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_81">Keep your eyes peeled and let me know when the event is over. I&#39;ll be around taking a nap. Good luck!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_126">Ha! Another prisoner in the slammer. Let&#39;s &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;improve the cell&lt;/color&gt; to receive more money from the state... and to make him happier, of course.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_136">We are going to buy another &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;table in the canteen&lt;/color&gt; so that everyone can sit down to eat. </entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_106">In the long run, the government supplies won&#39;t be enough.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_116">What the heck!? Looks like the prisoners are angry and have &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;started a riot&lt;/color&gt;. Don&#39;t worry, these things happen…</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_88">So, let&#39;s get to it! This can also be a good way to make profits.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_89">I&#39;ve already created a plan to build a military camp. New recruits to be trained will arrive soon.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73_JULY4TH">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Eagle Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_23_REDUCTED">Good, you’ve just improved the prisoners&#39; living conditions and the state will reward you by paying &lt;color=#52C25B&gt;more money&lt;/color&gt; for them.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_56">I’m off to check out the vending machine now! I hope it has a larger variety of snacks than the previous one…</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_57">Wow! Your iron hand with prisoners has given you quite a reputation!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_54">Here we are! In another hellhole. Let&#39;s see how you get on with these &quot;pillars of society.&quot;</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_55">This prison will be a tough one to manage: it’s bigger and has a zone for dangerous inmates. The other prisoners will seem like angels compared to these guys, so be ready!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98_JULY4TH">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These aliens&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_53">I&#39;m going with you of course! I don&#39;t mean to brag, but without me you wouldn&#39;t have gotten very far. Let&#39;s check out this new prison!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_17_REDUCTED">When a prisoner arrives, he is &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;assigned a cell&lt;/color&gt; and a guard escorts him to it.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_51">Wow, I&#39;m impressed! You managed to rehabilitate a considerable number of prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_58">I&#39;ve got bad news for you though. It seems the government is no longer willing to pay as much for keeping prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_59">So we need to make them work in the workshops to make some extra money.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73_HALLOWEEN">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Ghost Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_13_REDUCTED">The state also pays a fixed &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;fee for each hour a prisoner&lt;/color&gt; remains in the prison.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_24_REDUCTED">Remember that prisoners can get &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;stressed out&lt;/color&gt; and get very nervous if you don’t attend to their &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;needs&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_22_REDUCTED">Since the prisoners are going to spend a lot of time here, add a &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;shelf with some books&lt;/color&gt; so they have something to read.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83_EASTER">I have just been informed that a fleet of alien ships have been sighted entering the atmosphere with hostile intentions. They don&#39;t even respect Easter anymore...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_123">Prisoners will line up at &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;reception&lt;/color&gt; until the guards check in. but that can take forever!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_133">My guts are roaring and there&#39;s no one in the kitchen! It&#39;s getting close to lunchtime and we need to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;hire more cooks&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_103">One cooked ingredient will give you one meal. You can check the ingredients and meals you have in the kitchen.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_113">You think your prison is running smoothly? Really? Check out the permanent upgrades included in these &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;cards&lt;/color&gt;!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_10_REDUCTED">First thing you need to know is that the state pays us good &lt;color=#52C25B&gt;money&lt;/color&gt; for every new prisoner we take in.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73_EASTER">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Chocolate Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_36_REDUCTED">All prison employees have a salary which is &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;paid per hour&lt;/color&gt;, so make sure you have enough money to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;pay everyone&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_140">But first one of your guards has to lead the reformed prisoners to the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;exit&lt;/color&gt;. What a touching moment!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_15">Finally, if they serve their sentence and &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;are reformed&lt;/color&gt;, we&#39;ll also get &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;paid when they leave.&lt;/color&gt; It&#39;s a perfect business!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_120">Oh! The situation is out of control... When a riot is too big, &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;reinforcements will arrive&lt;/color&gt; to help you out.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_130">A couple of slackers less! Don&#39;t worry, you can hire and fire employees when it suits you best. The key is to always maintain a &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;positive balance&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_100">Space! At last! I always wanted to be in a spaceship prison. Well done, really well done!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_110">Well, we&#39;re here and what a forsaken place it is! This prison is bigger and has various &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;modules&lt;/color&gt; to separate the prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69_HALLOWEEN">A prison lost in the middle of the ocean! Vampires? Zombies? The monsters that are imprisoned here are much scarier...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_96">The current time needed is shown on the upper right-hand corner. As you can see, the time indicated now is quite high, but you can reduce the number of days by improving the base.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_97">Don’t forget that the recruits are still prisoners. They need and want to eat and have forms of entertainment, so be sure to keep an eye on them to avoid any trouble.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_94">Here we are. Let me explain a few things so you know how to proceed.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_95">For a recruit to become a soldier, he needs to spend some time in the base&#39;s training camp.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_92">It also shows the different rewards we can earn based on how well we are doing. We&#39;ll have to work hard to go up the ranking ladder.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_93">Let&#39;s go to the base.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_90">Come with me and I&#39;ll show you.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_91">This is the main information window. It shows how many soldiers we have trained and how we are ranking compared to the rest of the world.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_125">That&#39;s much better! Now &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;hire a couple more guards&lt;/color&gt; to keep things running smoothly.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_135">Lunchtime arrives and the prisoners line up in the dining room to receive their &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;rations&lt;/color&gt;. Look at them, they look like little angels.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_105">Don&#39;t forget you have to serve lunch and dinner with those, so make sure to manage them carefully.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_115">Cards don&#39;t grow on trees! They randomly come out of these chests. Let&#39;s &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;buy a chest&lt;/color&gt; and see how it works.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_99_IRON">Ah, before I forget: how do you want to be called?</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These aliens&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_99">Ah, before I forget: all war leaders need a name. How do you want to be called?</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_6_REDUCTED">Fantastic! A &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;bus&lt;/color&gt; full of prisoners is about to arrive.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_134">You will also need to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;upgrade the kitchen&lt;/color&gt; so that the cooks can cook rations to feed the prisoners.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_38_REDUCTED">You must also make sure the prison has enough &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;electricity&lt;/color&gt;  and &lt;color=#6FBEFF&gt;water&lt;/color&gt; to function properly.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_122">Finally! That&#39;s where the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;new inmates&lt;/color&gt; arrive in that rickety bus. Remember, more inmates means more money for the prison.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_98_HALLOWEEN">As long as you keep working like I taught you at the beginning, all will go well. These zombies&#39; days are numbered!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_26_REDUCTED">Prisoners have a color indicator that shows their &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;level of stress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_34">The cooks prepare and serve the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;meals&lt;/color&gt; in the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;dining hall.&lt;/color&gt;</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_73_VALENTINE">OK, let&#39;s go see what awaits us. By the way, the prison is called the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;Love Fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_31">This is the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;kitchen.&lt;/color&gt; We need &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;cooks&lt;/color&gt; to prepare the prisoners&#39; meals before lunchtime!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_STRESS_TITLE">Overall stress level</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_39">The electric generator and water pumping station provide electricity and water, but you&#39;ll need to upgrade them.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_66">Keep your eyes peeled! I wouldn&#39;t want things to get ugly and have to work more than necessary.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_67">I&#39;m back with more work… for you, of course!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69_EASTER">A lost prison made of chocolate! Rumor has it that it is inhabited by a rabbit that hides strange eggs in the most unexpected places...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_65">These guys are misfits and will be difficult to manage, but at least we&#39;ll make good money from them!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_62">Well, I&#39;m off to deal with the most important task of my day: finding a dry place to take a nap. This place, surrounded by icy water, has so much humidity that it chills you to the bone.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_63">Oh, before I forget: sometimes the government sends us &quot;special&quot; prisoners. One such prisoner has just arrived!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_60">For now, make sure to control your expenses and save as much money as possible to build a workshop.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_61">Once we have a workshop, prisoners will work a few hours a day making products we can then sell for profit.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_68">It looks like the government has found the perfect solution to safely contain the most dangerous prisoners in the world.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69">A prison lost in the middle of the ocean! A place where the worst of society will end up and which will be moved periodically so that no one can find them.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_129">Check the staff to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;fire&lt;/color&gt; employees who are not doing anything. </entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_139">The prisoners have already served their sentence and can return to society fully &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;reformed&lt;/color&gt;. </entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_109">Well, you know everything now, so I&#39;ll go for my drink! There&#39;s no swimming pool here, is there? A shame.  A swimming pool would have been nice!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_119">Well done! From now on, remember to keep your prisoners happy and hire more guards regularly to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;prevent more riots&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_69_CHRISTMAS">A frozen hell in the middle of the Arctic! A prison where children who misbehave get something much worse than a bag of coal...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_127">What do you think about &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;buying him a TV&lt;/color&gt;? That way he won&#39;t miss a single episode of his favorite soap opera.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_137">Gee, you&#39;ve used up all the electricity in the generator. We&#39;re going to need more &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;energy&lt;/color&gt; to keep upgrading the prison.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_8_REDUCTED">Here they are, the scoundrels. All prisoners need to be registered with an admission form in the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;admissions area&lt;/color&gt;.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_117">We&#39;re going to &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;hire more guards&lt;/color&gt; so the prisoners understand who is in charge here.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_45_REDUCTED">Good. The cell is already under construction. The &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;construction staff&lt;/color&gt; will finish the building, although it will take some time.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_83_VALENTINE">I have just been informed that a fleet of alien ships have been sighted entering the atmosphere with hostile intentions. They don&#39;t even respect Valentine&#39;s Day anymore...</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_124">Let&#39;s improve the &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;reception counters&lt;/color&gt; so that the guards can do their job faster. What a bunch of slackers!</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_30">By the way, its nearly lunchtime and we still have no &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;kitchen staff.&lt;/color&gt;</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_104">Thankfully, the government will provide us with some ingredients every day.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_114">There are cards with different &lt;color=#ff7200&gt;rarities&lt;/color&gt; and they all provide your prison with permanent advantages.</entry>
<entry name="TUTORIAL_107">Fortunately, you can build a garden to grow ingredients and make extra money!</entry>
