<entry name="DESCRIPTION">The world needs you!

Ancient evil creatures are destroying the Pillars of Creation. The foundations of the earth are shaken!

Accept your destiny as the Chosen One, find the Arcane Rings, and summon powerful heroes to help you protect the world.

No one knows how the Pillars of Creation were created. Some say they are as ancient as the universe itself, others think they were made by gods. Not much is known about the pillars, apart from one thing: they are linked to the destiny of the world.

We discovered the truth during the War of the Pillars. Hundreds of thousands of strange creatures appeared from nowhere, attacking the Pillars of Creation. We then learned that the destruction of the pillars would result in the destruction of the world.

Our legends tell the stories of brave heroes who stood against the evil creatures and defeated them. The legends also speak of the Arcane Rings, powerful objects the heroes wore to give them the strength to fight their enemies.

Hundreds of years have passed since the heroes defeated the dark army, and the legends have become children&apos;s tales. Most of us think of the legends as stories meant to entertain, not as accounts of the truth.

However, the stories are about to come to life… The evil creatures have returned... 

A war is coming, but the heroes of the legends are gone, and nobody remembers how to craft Arcane Rings anymore…

Yet there is still hope. Our most ancient song speaks of a powerful summoner who protects the world. A summoner who can bring back the heroes, and forge Arcane Rings again.

Are you the summoner we await? Will you help us?
